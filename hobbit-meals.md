Hobbits eat 6 or 7 meals per day depending on their adoption of second breakfast, as Bilbo did.
The seven meals are listed below with descriptions, approximate sizes, as well as some ideas for meal recipes.

It is worth noting that these meals come from 19<sup>th</sup> century British country mealtimes,
and do not quite align with modern mealtimes.
